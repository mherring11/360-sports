## Description

Just like a 360 dunk, 360 Sports is sure to get users out of their seats and on their feet.  360 Sports is a web application that provides users with the means to connect with and engage with other sports enthusiasts.  It currently offers the ability to post items that you no longer need or want, or to find items that you do want.
